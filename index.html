            This week I learned about Tinkercad and how to build different objects from
            real life. We learned about mechanical engineering and the ssafety measures
            we had to take to cut metal, weld, and saw. In Tinkercad we were told to build
            home appliances.

            This week we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines and my partners are Aiden, Danny, and Tigrin. We also
            had a challenge day where we made a 3D Model of and E, I wasn't there as I was helping my brother move in.

          This week we mainly worked on our Rube Goldberg Machines on tinkercad. Our challenge day was floating the most
          amount of weight on a piece of paper. My team made a boat.

          This week we finished our Rube Goldberg Machines Projects made out of cardboard. My teams machine popped the ballon
          on the first try. Our Challenge this week was to ghet a total number of all the urinals and toilets in the school... T_T

            This week we had no challenge because Mr.Poole was sick ;( Our assignment was to make
            an animal prosthetic in Tinkercad and I made a leg prosthetic for a cow.

            This week we dissected a computer, my partner was Alex and basically we both had already built our own pcs
            so seeing the parts such as the GPU, CPU, and other parts wasn't too suprising. However, we both learned about the different parts of a computer different from a PC.

             This week we wer put into teams, my teammates were Elias and Rafael we made a model rocket ship in Tinkercad made up of a 2L Coke bottle. Our challenge this week was to use a sheet of paper and 
             get closest to a an area in the quad. Everybody made paper airplanes, while Mr.Poole made a crumpled ball. Think smarter nor harder.
